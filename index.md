# Amadej Kristjan Kocbek

Data scientist specializing in Bayesian statistics, hierarchical modeling,
time series analysis, and computational inference.

I focus on building statistically principled, uncertainty-aware models for
real-world data, with applications in environmental science, social data,
and modern machine learning.

## Selected Projects

### 📉 Bayesian Time-Series Analysis of NO₂ Concentrations
**Bayesian time series · Stan · Model comparison**

Long-term NO₂ concentrations (1997–2025) modeled using Bayesian time-series
methods with explicit temporal dependence. Multiple models are compared using
PSIS-LOO cross-validation to avoid overfitting and quantify uncertainty.

### 🌍 Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Global Happiness
**Hierarchical models · Partial pooling · Uncertainty-aware rankings**

A single hierarchical Bayesian model analyzing global happiness survey data,
estimating global trends, continent-level heterogeneity, and probabilistic
country rankings while accounting for economic and health covariates.

### 🤖 Transformer Ablation Study (coming soon)
**PyTorch · Transformers · Experimental machine learning**

A minimal decoder-only Transformer implemented from scratch, with systematic
ablations of attention, residual connections, normalization, and positional
encoding to study their functional role.
